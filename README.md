In this project I created a one-line scrabble website with all the following features working as intended.
-	letter tiles in the player’s “hand” are selected randomly from a data structure with the proper
-	distribution of the letters
-	letter tiles can be dragged-and-dropped onto target Scrabble squares
-	program identifies which letter tile is dropped onto which Scrabble square
-	board includes at least two bonus squares
-	score is tallied correctly, including consideration of bonus square multipliers
-	any number of words can be played until the player wishes to quit or depletes all tiles
-	the board is cleared after each round so that a new word can be played
-	after playing a word, only the number of letter tiles needed to bring the player’s “hand” back
-	to 7 tiles are selected
-	score is kept for multiple words until the user restart a new game (implement next vs. restart)
-	Tiles can only be dragged from the “rack” to Scrabble board. If the user drop them anywhere
-	else, they will be bounced back to the “rack”.
-	Once the tile is placed on the Scrabble board, it can be moved back to the “rack”.
-	Except for the first letter, all sub-subsequent letters must be placed directly next to or below
-	another letter with no space. Else, they will bounce back to the “rack”.
-	user can always restart the game.
